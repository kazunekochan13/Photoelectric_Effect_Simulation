What is the threshold frequency of a metal?
The work function of a metal place is 1.1E-19J. Calculate the threshold frequency.
Light of wavelength 635nm is directed at a metal plate with a work function of 1.3E-19J. Find the maximum kinetic energy of emitted photoelectrons.
What does hf stand for?
Calculate the energy of a photon of wavelength 450nm giving your answer in MeV.
What does the work function of a metal represent?
Iridium(Ir) has a work function of 5.67MeV. What is the maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons when light of energy 63.7MeV is shone on the metal surface?
What would happen if the incident light has a frequency that is lower than the threshold frequency of the metal surface?
